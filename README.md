## Project Overview  
Waze is a popular navigation app used worldwide. This project aims to predict **user churn**, helping Waze improve retention strategies.  

## Project Objectives

- Detect churn-prone users based on historical behavioral data
- Build accurate classification models to predict churn
- Identify key factors influencing user retention
  
## Skills Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Statistical Analysis

## Project Structure  
- data/ -> Raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/ -> Jupyter Notebooks with EDA & model training
- scripts/ -> Reusable Python scripts
- results/ -> Model evaluation results
- index.html -> Project presentation page
- style.css -> Styling for the project page
- README.md -> Project documentation

## Key Insights  
- Low weekly usage and poor support experience are major churn indicators
- Engagement in events correlates strongly with retention
- Random Forest performed best in terms of generalization
